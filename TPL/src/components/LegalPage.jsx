The Peptide Lounge operates the Platform technology, manages customer accounts and billing, coordinates communications, and facilitates connections between Users, medical providers, and pharmacies. The Peptide Lounge is a technology and administrative services company.\n\nIndependent Network Physicians and Clinicians ("Platform Providers" or "PG"). PG is an independent, professionally licensed medical group and network composed exclusively of physicians who hold an active Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) license in good standing in the state in which the User is located at the time of consultation (each, a "Provider"). The Platform Providers are identified below. PG does not utilize Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or other non-M.D. clinicians to evaluate Users or issue prescriptions through the Platform. Providers affiliated with PG are responsible for evaluating Users, establishing the physician-patient relationship, making clinical decisions, issuing prescriptions when medically appropriate, and providing all medical care. The Platform Providers operate independently of The Peptide Lounge, and The Peptide Lounge does not control, direct, or interfere with the independent medical judgment of any Provider.\n\nThird-Party Licensed Pharmacies (the "Platform Pharmacy"). The Platform Pharmacy consists of one or more licensed pharmacies authorized to dispense prescription medications in all 50 United States. Each Platform Pharmacy is identified below. The Platform Pharmacy is responsible for the dispensing, labeling, packaging, and shipment of prescription medications pursuant to prescriptions issued by Providers. The Platform Pharmacy operates independently in accordance with applicable federal and state pharmacy laws and regulations.\n\nThe Platform Providers and the Platform Pharmacy are independent entities that contract with The Peptide Lounge for non-clinical administrative and technology support. Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship that would cause The Peptide Lounge to be deemed to be practicing medicine, pharmacy, or any other licensed profession.\n\nPlatform Providers: MD Integrations Clinician Network\n\nPlatform Pharmacies: Strive Compounding Pharmacy; MediVera Compounding Pharmacy™',

The Provider may, at their discretion, decline to issue a prescription, refer you to in-person care, or require additional information.\n• You have the right to withhold or withdraw consent at any time without affecting your right to future care or treatment, and you have the right to request a copy of your medical records.\n• You understand that the laws that protect the privacy and confidentiality of medical information also apply to telehealth, and no information obtained in the use of telehealth that identifies you will be disclosed without your consent except as permitted by law.\n\nBy proceeding with a consultation, you affirm that you have read this section, understand its contents, and consent to receive telehealth services on the basis described.',

The word "Provider" means a physician holding an active Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) license in good standing in the state in which you are located at the time of consultation. PG does not utilize Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or other non-M.D. clinicians.\n\nBy electronically signing this Consent or by clicking "I agree" where presented, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and voluntarily consent to receive healthcare services through telehealth as described below.',

        text: 'The Peptide Lounge operates a technology platform that facilitates connections between Users and (i) an independent medical group of M.D. Physicians ("Platform Providers," "PG," "Provider," and "Providers"), and (ii) one or more licensed pharmacies ("Platform Pharmacy").\n\nInformation you share with PG or Platform Pharmacy as part of your medical care — including your medical history, intake answers, prescriptions, lab results, and clinical communications with your Provider — is protected health information ("PHI") governed by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"). That information is described in PG\'s separate Notice of Privacy Practices and Platform Pharmacy\'s Notice of Privacy Practices, not in this Notice. HIPAA-regulated PHI is not subject to this Notice.\n\nThis Notice covers the non-PHI Consumer Health Data that The Peptide Lounge collects in operating the Platform — for example, the condition pages you browse, the products you view or purchase, the marketing audiences we associate you with, and approximate location data when used to infer a health interest. State consumer health privacy laws regulate this category of data even when it is not PHI under HIPAA.',

As applied to The Peptide Lounge, Consumer Health Data may include:\n\n• The fact that you have visited the Platform or specific pages on the Platform that relate to particular health conditions, treatments, or symptoms;\n• Products and services you browse, place in a cart, purchase, or subscribe to through the Platform;\n• Marketing preferences and audience segments associated with specific health conditions or treatment areas;\n• Approximate location information (e.g., derived from IP address) when used to infer that you are seeking health services;\n• Inferences, derivative data, or proxy data we generate from non-health data that we use to identify a health status, condition, treatment need, or attempt to seek health services; and\n• Identifiers (such as account ID, email, advertising ID, or hashed identifiers) when associated with any of the above.\n\nConsumer Health Data does not include de-identified data, publicly available information, or PHI governed by HIPAA.',

      {
        heading: '3. Categories of Consumer Health Data We Collect',
        text: 'We collect the following categories of Consumer Health Data through the Platform:\n\n• Browsing and engagement data with health context — pages viewed within the Platform that relate to specific conditions or treatments; search terms entered on the Platform; links clicked in marketing emails about specific health topics.\n• Product and subscription data — products viewed, added to cart, purchased, or subscribed to; refill activity; cancellation activity.\n• Approximate location — general geographic location derived from IP address.\n• Marketing audience and preference data — marketing list segments, communication preferences related to specific conditions, engagement with health-related campaigns.\n• Identifiers used in advertising and analytics — cookies, mobile advertising IDs, device identifiers, hashed email or phone, when associated with any of the above.\n• Inferences — inferences drawn from any of the above to identify a health status, condition, treatment need, or attempt to seek health services.\n\nWe do not include PHI in any of the above categories. Information you submit to your Provider through medical intake forms, secure messaging, photographs for clinical review, lab results, and prescription records is PHI governed by HIPAA and is not used by The Peptide Lounge outside of the clinical and pharmacy purposes described in PG\'s and Platform Pharmacy\'s Notices of Privacy Practices.',

We do not share Consumer Health Data with law enforcement based solely on its content (for example, browsing related to reproductive or gender-affirming care) absent valid legal process we are required to honor.',

PHI is never shared with advertising or analytics partners.\n\nWe will not share Consumer Health Data with advertising partners for advertising purposes unless you have provided separate, opt-in valid authorization. Where required by law, we obtain that authorization through a clear, standalone consent flow — separate from our general Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and cookie banner — that identifies the specific categories of Consumer Health Data being shared; identifies the specific recipients (or categories of recipients) that will receive the data; identifies the purposes of the sharing; states the duration of the authorization; discloses your right to revoke the authorization at any time and how to do so; and is signed (electronically) by you and dated, with a copy made available to you.\n\nYou may withdraw your authorization at any time by contacting us using the information in Section 11. Withdrawing authorization will stop future sharing for advertising purposes; it will not unwind data already shared in reliance on a prior authorization.\n\nWe honor recognized opt-out signals such as Global Privacy Control ("GPC") where required by applicable law.',
